                <h2>MY BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                <p><b>ABOUT ME:</b>

                  <br>  I am a passionate and dedicated learner currently pursuing my education at Ajay Kumar Garg. With a
                    strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and problem-solving, I thrive on tackling
                    complex coding challenges and optimizing solutions for efficiency. My expertise in Python allows me
                    to develop scalable applications, automate processes, and work on data-driven projects.

                    In addition to my problem-solving abilities, I have hands-on experience in web development. I enjoy
                    designing and building interactive and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My
                    projects reflect a keen understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, ensuring seamless user
                    experiences and functionality.</br>

                    Currently, I am interning at Coding Jr, where I am collaborating with a team of 10 to build a
                    copilot for CRED. This experience has enhanced my teamwork, problem-solving, and software
                    development skills, allowing me to work on real-world applications and improve my ability to develop
                    practical solutions.

                    Beyond my existing skills, I am eager to expand my knowledge in artificial intelligence. The rapid
                    advancements in AI fascinate me, and I am actively exploring machine learning concepts using
                    libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I aim to integrate AI into
                    my future projects and leverage its power to create intelligent solutions.

                    I am always open to learning, collaborating, and working on innovative projects that challenge my
                    abilities and help me grow as a developer.</p>
